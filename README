TODOs:
	Semantics:
		- array initializers only in declarations
		- break/continue inside loops
		- System.out.println() (manually included in symtab)
		- check operators' types and returns
		
		---> symbols with the same name and different types
		- functions with the same name as variables need to be allowed
		- function overload

	Semantic choices
		don't allow:
			"float[] a[]" in function parameters
			redefinition of global variables (that would make them inaccessible)
			function overloading

		allow:
			for (i= 0; i < n; i++)
				int i;

TODO:
		terminated bool in all block stmts (if, for, etc) -> check input5.pja
