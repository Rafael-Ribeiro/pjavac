TODOs:
	Semantics:
		- array initializers only in declarations
		- break/continue inside loops
		- System.out.println() (manually included in symtab)
		- check operators' types and returns
		
		---> symbols with the same name and different types
		- functions with the same name as variables need to be allowed
		- function overload
