TODO:
	because of the way error works:
		

		if we have
			i[1+
		in the input, and a rule that tries to match
			[error]

		1+ --> gets marked as an error
		discard input until we get a ']'  (possibly never)

	ALSO
		END tokens seem to be infinite :X
		this makes the error correction to loop;

	can be checked using the application error rule (take forces a match with a END)
