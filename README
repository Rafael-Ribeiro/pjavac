TODOs:
	Semantics:
		- array initializers only in declarations
		- break/continue inside loops
		- System.out.println() (manually included in symtab)
		- "terminated" bool after each block  
-->>>>	- main() prototype
-->>>	CHECK TABLES

		---> symbols with the same name and different types
		- functions with the same name as variables need to be allowed
		- function overload

	Semantic choices
		don't allow:
			"float[] a[]" in function parameters
			redefinition of global variables (that would make them inaccessible)
			function overloading
			function var args (ellipsis)
			% and %= operators envolving floating point types (because C doesn't allow them)

		allow:
			for (i= 0; i < n; i++)
				int i;

			==, !=, <, >, <= and >= on strings



TODO Code Generation:
		add frame counter to all variables (locals and globals)

		local variable is accessed trough local frame
		global variables are accessed trough global's table (--> make this a single "global" frame?) 

		translate functions
				-> caller defined?
				-> calee defined?
			+ headers
			+ foooters
				+ redirector?
